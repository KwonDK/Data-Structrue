<p>H/W of Data_Structure</p>
<h1 id="explanation">Explanation</h1>
<ul>
<li>To understand how to work structures in C</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="nd-work">1nd work</h1>
<ul>
<li>Making Linked list by use C</li>
<li>Using structure and header file to read and understand easily</li>
<li>Using ‘malloc’ and ‘scanf’ to add data dynamically</li>
<li>Using Pointer because of the limitation of array (Array is static data. We can’t stretch it’s range dynamically)</li>
<li>‘While’ is more convenient than ‘For’ at dynamic data (If we use ‘For’, we have to make another variable. In terms of Memory, this is very wasteful.)</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="nd-work-1">2nd work</h1>
<ul>
<li>Making a Factorial code</li>
<li>By using variable ‘compare’, we can make more active code.</li>
<li>Function ‘fact’ should be able to recognize numbers below 1 and return the results. So I added a code to return this result.</li>
</ul>
